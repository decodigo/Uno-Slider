Uno Slider
===========================

UnoSlider is a jQuery plugin for creating simple, yet elegant and versatile content sliders. It's great for when you need to get a slider going in a jiffy, yet it has enough depth to create news tickers and tabs. All without overwhelming you with options and features you don't need.
